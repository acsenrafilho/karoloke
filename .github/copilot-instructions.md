# ASL toolkit Copilot Instructions

- Focus on the `karoloke` Python library for a simple and easy to use Karaoke framework.
- Prefer code and APIs from the workspace.
- Use concise, clear bullet points and code examples.
- Reference workspace files and symbols with links when possible.
- Follow the project's coding style and documentation patterns (Nummpy docstrings).
- Suggest improvements or fixes based on the workspace context.
- Avoid general Python advice unless relevant to the workspace.
- Respect the project's contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
- Use supported video formats described at the `settings.py` `VIDEO_FORMATS` definition.
- Use the `task` command for running tasks defined in `pyproject.toml`.
- Use `poetry` for managing dependencies and running tasks.
- Use `pytest` for running tests and generating coverage reports.
- When creating commit messages, make it as more complete and descriptive as possible and use the following prefixes:
  - `ENH:` for new features and enhancements
  - `BUG:` for bug fixes in general and correcting broken code
  - `DOC:` for documentation changes
  - `STY:` for formatting and code style changes (not affecting code logic)
  - `TEST:` for adding or updating tests
  - `WIP:` for temporary work in progress commits
